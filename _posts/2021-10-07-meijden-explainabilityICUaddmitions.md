  abstract: |
  Siri van der Meijden, who just started her PhD on this topic, will present her master’s thesis, where she compared several types of machine learning models on predictive performance and explainability for the prediction of ICU readmission. Afterwards we will have room for discussion about how explainable AI models should be.
